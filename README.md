# jsonutils_demo

This is a dotnet code 2.0 console app to demo the usage of class object as model in C#.

This console app consumes government web api to get all Powerball lottery draw information.

It does a simple HTTP GET call to download JSON data, and then deserializes the string data to C# class objects.

I posted a blog on 'How to generate model classes from JSON string?'.

To demostrate the general purpose of the models in backend apps, i have created this project.
